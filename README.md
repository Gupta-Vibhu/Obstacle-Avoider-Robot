# Obstacle-Avoider-Robot
The Obstacle Avoider Robot is an autonomous mobile robot designed to navigate its environment while avoiding
obstacles in its path. It utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect objects in its vicinity. The data from the sensors is
processed by an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which calculates the distance to obstacles and decides the
appropriate movement. The robot's motion is powered by DC motors, controlled by an L293D motor driver IC,
allowing the robot to move forward, turn, or stop as needed. Additionally, a servo motor is used to rotate the
ultrasonic sensor, enabling the robot to scan its surroundings and choose the optimal path. This project combines
fundamental robotics, electronics, and programming principles.
